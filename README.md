# aws_investigation_toolkit (AIT)
All the investigation tool(s), without the incomprehensible name


See the Wiki for install, usages, etc


I'm expect 2 situations when people arrive at this project:
1. "We use/collect CloudTrail, but we process use the data in a log aggregation platform e.g. Splunk, Sumologic, Loggly, etc. Thats expensive and only keeps getting more expensive. I'm looking for a way to reduce cost will retaining capability or even better increase capability become some of those platforms suck at handling nested json."
2. "We don't collect CloudTrail logs but think we should be. If you've got a good solution we're in"


What AIT aiming's to do:
- Be the lowest barrier of entry to CloudTrail log analysis
    - Barriers of entry are cost, complexity, mostly anything thats stopping you doing it today
    - It's likely never going to be as easy to use for complex analysis as commercial log analsys products.
    - However when considering all the barriers of entry it intends to be champion of the sum total

How often are you working on this:
- In my spare time, this isn't funded/supported project

Why no license?:
- Because I don't know what path I want to talk. I can't imagine this ever becoming closed source, still I want to understand my options further before proceeding further.
